--TODO--

   +	Figure out why Links browser doesn't work.

--1.0--

	Initial release. Submission to the IOCCC 2004.

--0.8--

   +	Add support for SCRIPT_FILENAME for PHP/CGI.
   
   +	Restructured directories.
   
   +	Added autoconf configure.in script and friends.

--0.7--

   !	Replaced print() macro by expansion in status(). Only used in one
   	place. This also fixes a macro expansion bug in status().
   	
   !	status() now correctly passes the size of the status response
   	headers to send().
   	
   !	Fixed transform.sed which incorrectly transform Host: header string
   	into h:.
   	
   +	Experimented with configure.in and makefile.in. Not really
	necessary and the testing of macros resulting #defines in the
	source would exceed the size limit.

--0.6--

   !	Renamed error() to status(). Set content-length to that of the
   	response message or static file.

   +	Added more details comments with citiations of relavent paragraphs
   	from RFC 2616 and the CGI/1.1 specification.

   !	Enlarged header parsing buffer from 4KB to 8KB.

   !	Changed parsing of request CRLF to allow for just LF.

   +	Fold case of request headers to lower case, because of problem with
   	Lynx not specifying headers as they appear in RFC 2616.

--0.5--

   +	First attempt static file web server, with virtual host support.

   +	Added support for CGI/1.1 specification, in particular "nph" CGIs
      	with a selected set of necessary environment variables.
