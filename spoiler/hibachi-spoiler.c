 *
 * 	Japanese for "fire bowl", a hibachi is just that - a small
 * 	(generally cast-iron) container made for holding fuel
 * 	(usually charcoal). A grill that sits on top of the bowl
 * 	is used to cook various foods. Hibachis come in square,
 * 	oblong and round models. Because of their compact size,
 * 	they're completely portable.
 *
 * Usage: SERVER_PORT=<port> DOCUMENT_ROOT=<path> hibachi

   The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a

   is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after
   some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a
   Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD
   handle the response as it would for a 500 response.

      Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a
      server must use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers may wish
      to simply refuse the connection.
